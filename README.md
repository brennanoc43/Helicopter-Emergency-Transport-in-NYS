# Helicopter Emergency Transport in Upstate New York

This repository focuses on a simulation analysis of helicopter transport operations in the upstate New York
area to help determine how many helicopters are needed and where they should be based. 

- Heli contains our analysis and final report
- Heli contains the source code for our simluation model
- ProjectData.csv contains the year's worth of emergency call and flight data used in our project

This project was developed as a final project for ORIE 4580: Simulation Modeling and Analysis (taught by Shane Henderson) in the Fall '21 semester. Our analysis was conducted by myself, Amanda Gang, Samantha Taylor, and Yoanna Efimova.
